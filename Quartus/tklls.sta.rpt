Info: Running Quartus II TimeQuest Timing Analyzer
    Info: Version 9.0 Build 184 04/29/2009 Service Pack 1 SJ Web Edition
    Info: Processing started: Sun Sep 23 00:16:12 2018
Info: Command: quartus_sta tklls -c tklls
Info: qsta_default_script.tcl version: #1
Info: Low junction temperature is 0 degrees C
Info: High junction temperature is 85 degrees C
Warning: Found USE_TIMEQUEST_TIMING_ANALYZER=OFF. The TimeQuest Timing Analyzer is not the default Timing Analysis Tool during full compilation.
Critical Warning: Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'tklls.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info: No user constrained base clocks found in the design. Calling "derive_clocks -period 1.0"
Info: The command derive_clocks did not find any clocks to derive.  No clocks were created or changed.
Warning: No clocks defined in design.
Info: No clocks to report
Info: Analyzing Slow Model
Info: No fmax paths to report
Info: No setup paths to report
Info: No hold paths to report
Info: No recovery paths to report
Info: No removal paths to report
Info: No minimum pulse width or minimum period width checks to report
Info: The selected device family is not supported by the report_metastability command.
Info: Analyzing Fast Model
Info: Started post-fitting delay annotation
Warning: Found 1 output pins without output pin load capacitance assignment
    Info: Pin "pin_name37" has no specified output pin load capacitance -- assuming default load capacitance of 0 pF for timing analysis
Info: Delay annotation completed successfully
Info: No user constrained base clocks found in the design. Calling "derive_clocks -period 1.0"
Info: The command derive_clocks did not find any clocks to derive.  No clocks were created or changed.
Warning: No clocks defined in design.
Info: No setup paths to report
Info: No hold paths to report
Info: No recovery paths to report
Info: No removal paths to report
Info: No minimum pulse width or minimum period width checks to report
Info: The selected device family is not supported by the report_metastability command.
Warning: At least one of the filters had some problems and could not be matched.
    Warning: * could not be matched with a clock.
Info: Design is fully constrained for setup requirements
Info: Design is fully constrained for hold requirements
Info: Quartus II TimeQuest Timing Analyzer was successful. 0 errors, 7 warnings
    Info: Peak virtual memory: 214 megabytes
    Info: Processing ended: Sun Sep 23 00:16:13 2018
